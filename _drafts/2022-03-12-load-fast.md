# Introduction

When we are interested in the migration/modernization of projects we talk about modeling or meta models. Moose revolves around a powerful Famix meta model that allows us to do several operations. For instance, previous posts present the analysis and requesting a model, visualizing a model with plantUML or even creating a model, etc.

FAST is a meta-model that helps us understand source code in a less abstract way. Indeed, FAST is based on AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) which is close to the source code. And as the devil is in the details, FAST contains interesting elements when analyzing programs (for example some specific expression statement), and effectively this is what makes the difference between FAST and FAMIX.
(Consult this [overview](https://modularmoose.org/moose-wiki/Developers/Parsers/FAST) about the FAST model).

In this blog we will talk about how to load, generate a FAST model of Java code. For this we will take ArgoUML, an open-source Java project, as an example.

# Overview & Prerequisites

First of all, we have to understand from where we are going to start and where we are going to end up. As already mentioned, we will take the AgroUMLâ€™s java code and the goal is to generate the corresponding AST and do analyses above. To do this, 3 steps are necessary to have the AST as illustrated in the figure below:

1. Parse Java to build FAMIX model
2. Load the model into Moose
3. Generate the AST

![Steps for generating FAST Model](/img/posts/2022-03-14-load-fast/Overview.png)

Before starting, it is better to download [the source code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XYLfNtWd2Sc5rlEUtF6c1z4KN1MC0J2H/view) and [the famix model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZQQYedGKWlC7whj92uErpfbI7T-kSjGC/view) of the AgroUML project, step 1 of the diagram above (follow this [blog](https://fuhrmanator.github.io/2019/07/29/AnalyzingJavaWithMoose.html) for more details).

# Configuration

Okay ! First of all, we will import the FAMIX model from the ArgoUML-0-34 JSON file in the Models Browser. Then, we should know that FAST is specific to the programming language, i.e for a Pharo code we need FAST for Pharo, for an X language code we need the FAST model for the X language. Right now, we have FAST Java and FAST Pharo.

In the following, we will generate the AST of a class (or method) for Pharo/Java code in a different way.

## Generate FastJava model:

In this section we start from a class/method of the java model and we will load its FAST.

First, we need to install Fast Java for example by running the following script on Moose Playground:

```st
Metacello new
    githubUser: 'moosetechnology' project: 'FAST-JAVA' commitish: 'v2' path: 'src';
    baseline: 'FASTJava';
    load: 'all'
```

Next, we will add the model to the Playground

![Add Model on Playground](/img/posts/2022-03-14-load-fast/AddModelPlayground.png)

We got this :

```st
argoUML034 := MooseModel root at: 1.
```

We pick any model class from the model :

```st
class := argoUML034 allModelClasses anyOne.
```

And finally we generate the AST using generateFastJava :

```st
class generateFastJava
```

In the next section, we will generate the AST in another way. We start from Java code as string and we will load the corresponding FAST model.

## Java code as string:

In this case, we will not proceed as above. Instead, we will use a specialized importer "FAST-Java importer" to import AST from a method source code :

```st
JavaSmaCCProgramNodeImporterVisitor new
  parseCodeMethodString: 'public boolean covidTest(Person person) {
    if(testCovid(person) == "POSITIVE"){
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }'
```

## Pharo class or method:

To represent the AST of a Pharo class or method we need to install FASTPharo using the following script:

```st
Metacello new
    baseline: 'FASTPharo';
    repository: 'github://moosetechnology/FAST-Pharo:v2/src';
    load: 'importer'.
```

For example, the following script import the method testVisitInheritance of FamixMMUMLDocumentorVisitorTest :

```st
FASTSmalltalkImporterVisitor new
  runWithSource:
		(FamixMMUMLDocumentorVisitorTest >> #testVisitInheritance)
			sourceCode
```

# Navigating Through AST

One nice way to explore a FAST model is to use the source code and the tree extensions of the inspector. It allows one to navigate in a FAST model and see the code corresponding to each node.

To use it, we start from the Java model loaded above. Then, we select a model method entity. On the right-hand pane of the inspector, select the Tree tab, on the left-hand pane, select the source code extension. The source code is highlighted and the area selected corresponds to the entity selected in the right-hand panel. ( from [FAST-Pharo article](https://modularmoose.org/moose-wiki/Developers/Parsers/FAST-Pharo) )

# Conclusion

In this post, we have seen how to load the AST of a Pharo/Java model using FAST. The FAST model is useful when we need to understand more details about our model (for example identifiers, expression statements .. etc) which are not provided by FAMIX.
