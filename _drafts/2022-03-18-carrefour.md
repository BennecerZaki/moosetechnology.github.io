# Introduction

In order to analyze software systems, the Famix meta model provides enough abstraction to understand how models work. However when we are interested in details, the FAST (Famix AST) meta model provides less abstraction and gives us more information about our model (for example expression statements, identifiers *etc.*). In some situations, such as modernization/migration projects, we need the binding between the two meta models. And here Carrefour comes in!

![Carrefour](/img/posts/2022-03-18-carrefour/Carrefour.png)

Carrefour represents a two-way link between Famix and FAST, it allows us to navigate on the AST and at the same time return to the elements of FAMIX if we needed it.

# Configuration

In this blog, we are going to use a simple snippet of code to simplify and grasp all necessary concepts we should know about FAST & Carrefour & Famix. Consider the MyClass class and the following methodAB method :

```st
class MyClass {
  public int methodAB(int a, int b){
    if (a > b) {
      a = a + 2;
    } else {
      b = 1;
    }
    return b;
  }
}

```

Let's prepare the ground for using Carrefour by generating the Famix model of the MyClass class using verveinj. Open a code editor and create a new `MyClass.java` file. Inside the Java file, we add the code above.

To generate the Famix Java model we use verveinj by running this cammand in the MyClass java file directory :

```sh
/path/to/VerveineJ/verveinej.sh -format json -o MyClass.json -anchor assoc -autocp ./ ./
```

**PS:Note that Carrefour uses entities & associations as source anchor information, so make sure to add the option -anchor assoc.**

## Load Carrefour:

In this section we start from the MyClass Famix java model and we try to make the link between Famix and FAST using Carrefour.
First, we need to install Carrefour, for example by running the following script on Moose Playground:

```st
Metacello new
    githubUser: 'badetitou' project: 'Carrefour' commitish: 'v3' path: 'src';
    baseline: 'Carrefour';
    load
```

Then we import the MyClass model and pick the first class ( which is the only class MyClass ).

```st
'/path/to/MyClass.json' asFileReference readStreamDo: [ :stream |
	  model := FamixJavaModel new importFromJSONStream: stream
  ].
model rootFolder: '/path/to/MyClass/Directory/'.
method := model allModelClasses first.

```

Now, we call Carrefour to generate the AST (the figure below) and do the bind with Famix

```st
  method generateFastAndBind
```

![Class Code in left and the generated AST in right ](/img/posts/2022-03-18-carrefour/AST.jpg){: .img-fill }
_itâ€™s recommended to use `generateFastIfNotDoneAndBind` instead of `generateFastAndBind` in complex project and heavy computation when generating AST_

# Bidirectional binding

To have a complete vision on the meta models described above, we give the corresponding figures of each meta model FAST and FAMIX :

![Famix & Fast Overview](/img/posts/2022-03-18-carrefour/FastandFamix.jpg){: .img-fill }

Once Carrefour has been called and the binding is done, we will have the first links between the meta models as follows :

![Famix & Fast 1st call](/img/posts/2022-03-18-carrefour/FastandFamix1stCall.jpg){: .img-fill }

## From FAST to Famix :

As example, for the condition level variable ( a>b ) in FAST we would want its correspondence in Famix. To do this, we send the famixVariable message to the FASTJavaVariableExpression object and we will have the corresponding famix variable as follows:

![FamixVariable Call](/img/posts/2022-03-18-carrefour/famixVar2.jpg){: .img-fill }

## From Famix to FAST :

Now we go in the opposite direction, we will access all the matches of the variable famix a in the FAST metamodel. For this, we use the fastAccesses message as in the figure :

![fastAccesses Call](/img/posts/2022-03-18-carrefour/FastandFamixBack.jpg){: .img-fill }

Carrefour also provides the fastDeclaration API to get where a Famix variable has been declared at the FAST metamodel:

# Conclusion

As conclusion, Carrefour allows us to go back and forth between FAST and FAMIX metamodels. The example used in the blog post is not complex but allowed us to see how to navigate between the two metamodels. In large projects, where there is more initialization, invocation and relationships between entities Carrefour is much more practical ðŸ’ª.
